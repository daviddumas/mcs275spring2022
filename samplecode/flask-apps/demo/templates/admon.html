<h1>Hey</h1>
<p>Have you read the <a href="https://www.dumas.io/teaching/2022/spring/mcs275/nbview/projects/project4.html">project 4 description</a> yet?  Maybe you want to take a look!</p>
<p>Here is random number: {{ random_integer  }}  </p>
<p>While this HTML document has dynamic content, it is generated using a template rather than embedding a string in the Python source file.</p>
<p>Templates go in the <code>/templates</code> subdirectory.  You pass the template filename and kwargs for template variables to <code>flask.render_template</code>.  It returns the HTML (which you would typically use as the return value for a Flask route).</p>
