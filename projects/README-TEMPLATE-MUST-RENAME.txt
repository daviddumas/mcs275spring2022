# (TITLE OF YOUR PROJECT HERE)

MCS 275 Spring 2022 Project 4 by (YOUR NAME)

## Assignment

(Write a 50-250 word "assignment" that your work provides a solution to.  That
is, write a request for an application, a set of features, etc., so that your
work could be seen as a completion of that assignment.  E.g. don't say "I added
A, B, and C".  Instead, say "Build a Z that can be used to W..." and explain A,
B, C in the section about your contribution.)

## How to test

(50-250 words about how to use your program, with sample commands to run in the
terminal and/or URLs to visit, if applicable.  Must make sense without having
looked at your source code.)

## Personal contribution

(What part of the work to create this project was your personal contribution?
Be detailed and specific.  If you used components built by others or example
code from textbooks or online references, that's fine, but this is the section
where I want to know what you personally contributed.  If that consisted of
writing new components from scratch, enumerate them and describe what you did.
If it consisted of making existing components work together, explain what that
entailed and how you did it.)

## Sources and credits

(List every person or resource you consulted while preparing your project and
how they contributed.  Any code that was used in your project that was written
by someone else---even if you modified it---requires a detailed citation to be
given in comments in the source code IN ADDITION to being listed here as a
source.)
